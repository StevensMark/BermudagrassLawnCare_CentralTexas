        <p>Bermudagrass is a perennial, warm-season grass, and grows most actively from late spring through the hot summer months.</p>
        <div class="cal-cbox-and-text">

            </ul>
        </div>        
        <p>Extensive root system makes it more resilient than other warm-season grasses. Roots are generally within six inches from the surface, but can reach six feet or more in depth.
        <br>
        <img id="bermuda_grass_diagram" src="https://i.postimg.cc/dtVcvx8h/bermuda-grass-diagram-final.png">
        <br>
          Bermudagrass has the fastest growth rate of any of the common warm-season grasses. It spreads by both above-ground stems, known as stolons, and below-ground stems called rhizomes. An aggressive growth rate makes Bermudagrass challenging to contain, but able to endure heavy use.
        <br>
        <br>
        It goes dormant and turns brown during the Winter months and then re-enters active growth once soil temperatures warm to at least 65°F.

        <p><strong>Ideal height:</strong> 1.0 - 2.0 inches</p>
        <p>Bermudagrass is healthier when it's kept short, because a lower height influences the grass to grow horizontally, making the lawn thicker and fuller.</p>
        <div class="cal-cbox-and-text">
            <ul>
              <li><span class="content-bullet-item">&#9900;</span>It has a wide range of acceptable heights; 5/8 to 2 1/2 inches.</li>

            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Mowing at a grass height below 1 inch would require a reel mower, level ground, and meticulous care. The vast majority of people have rotary mowers, and uneven lawns, so most bermudagrass lawns in Central Texas should be maintained between 1.0 and 2.0 inches.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Ideal frequency:</strong> Two mows per week</p>
        <p>It's important to mow bermuda grass regularly.</p>

              <li><span class="content-bullet-item">&#9900;</span>There is a risk of scalping the lawn if more than 1/3 is removed.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Scalping:</strong></p>
        <p>Scalping occurs when the grass is cut so short that the green blade is removed, and the brown stem is exposed.</p>

        <header id="feeding" class="on-page-anchor">Feeding</header>
        <p>Because of its aggressive growth rate, Bermudagrass requires regular feeding during peak growth.</p>
        <p>Test the soil to determine what nutrients your lawn needs.</p>
        <p>If you do not have the soil tested, use a complete fertilizer with a 3-1-2 ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Every bag of fertilizer has the nutritional analysis printed on the bag; Examples: 15-5-10, 21-7-14, etc.</p>
        <p><strong>Soluble nitrogen</strong></p><p>Apply 1 pound of soluble nitrogen per 1,000 square feet of lawn every 4 to 6 weeks.</p>
        <p><strong>Slow-release nitrogen</strong></p><p>Apply 1.5 pounds of slow-release nitrogen fertilizer every 8 to 10 weeks.</p>
        <p>To determine the amount of fertilizer to apply to equal 1 pound of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet, divide 100 by the first number in the fertilizer analysis.</p>
        <p>(To determine the amount needed to apply 1.5 pounds per 1,000 square feet, substitute 150 for 100.) For example, if you are using a 15-5-10 fertilizer, then 6.6 pounds of fertilizer per 1,000 square feet will be needed. 100  15 = 6.6 Then determine the size of the area to be fertilized.</p>
        <p>If your lawn is 5,000 square feet, it will need 33 pounds of 15-5-10 fertilizer:</p>
        <p>(5,000 / 1,000) x 6.6 = 33 pounds of fertilizer</p>

                  <li><span class="content-bullet-check">&#10004;</span>Begin fertilizing at the beginning of the new growing season, after the grass turns green and there is little chance of a late frost.</li>

        <p><strong>Pre-emergent</strong></p>
        <p>Crabgrass seeds germinate when soil temperatures hit 55 degrees Fahrenheit. In Central Texas lawns, that can be early February or even late January some years.</p>
        <p>To control crabgrass and other grassy weeds, apply "crabgrass pre-emergent" and general pre-emergent herbicides before their seeds germinate. Measure the soil temperature 1 inch deep (A standard meat thermometer will work).</p>
        <p><strong>Post-emergent</strong></p>
        <p>Apply postemergent herbicides (which control weeds that have already sprouted) when weeds are present and the grass is healthy and actively growing. Control broadleaf weeds with herbicides that contain 2,4-D, MCPP or dicamba. Grassy weeds can be controlled by applying MSMA at 7- to 10-day intervals. Weed control is most effective if you apply the herbicide when the weeds are still very small. Read the label carefully before applying any herbicide to ensure that it is the right product for the weeds you have and that it does not damage the turf. Follow all the instructions on the label. It explains how and when to use the product and how much to apply.</p>
        <p>The best form of weed control is a healthy, dense, actively growing lawn.</p>

        <p>With warm-season grasses like Bermudagrass, month-by-month lawn care occurs on a different timetable than grasses grown in the north. This grass flourishes in summer heat and grows most vigorously in hot summer months. By timing lawn care tasks to complement its seasonal cycles, you can help your Bermudagrass lawn look and perform its best.

The farther south you live, the earlier weed seeds and Bermudagrass awaken and begin to grow. Weather conditions can vary significantly from year to year, so look to your grass for the final word. If you're unsure about typical frost cycles for your area, contact your local county extension office for help. Then follow this lawn care calendar for a lush Bermudagrass lawn.</p>

          <p>Mow to maintain Bermudagrass at 1 to 1 1/2 inches. Never remove more than one-third of the blade in a single mowing. During peak growth, Bermudagrass may need mowing more than once per week.</p>

          <p class="calendar-month-subheading">Watering</p>

          <p>Bermudagrass is drought-tolerant, but it will go dormant during periods of extended drought. To avoid summer dormancy, give your Bermuda lawn 1 to 1 1/2 inches of water from rainfall or supplemental irrigation each week.</p>

          <p class="calendar-month-subheading">Soil Testing</p>

          <p>Test your lawn soil every three to four years to confirm soil pH. Bermudagrass grows best with pH between 5.8 and 7.0, but it will tolerate more alkalinity.2 In areas with overly acidic soil, Bermudagrass lawns need lime to thrive.</p>
